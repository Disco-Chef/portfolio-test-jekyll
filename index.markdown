      <p>Having experienced first hand the benefits of the knowledge offered at the bootcamp, as well as the empowerment of self that occurs when one finds understanding, it made perfect sense to help others initialise their potential in development while searching for a developer position job. Seeing as my family is filled with teachers and professors, I don't know why I was actually surprised that it turned out to be a such a good fit! Currently, I am a teaching assistant for the students in both the full-time and part-time course.</p>

        <p>One of the few bakeries/pastry shops that is also a provider to the Royal Court of Belgium and Jean-Michel Loriers. Made the daily pastries for the store front as well as special orders for VIP clients. I used to think cooks had it difficult and then I saw what it was like to work in a pastry workshop and realised that cooks have it way too easy! I became the unrelenting work-machine that I am today thanks to the people at Dekimpe.</p>

This time in a matter that I thought was a bit more people-oriented than engineering that would also be a lot easier. Turns out both were only slightly truth-y, but it still made for a good degree and acquisition of knowledge.</p>
